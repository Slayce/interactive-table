# interactive-table
Program used in a project to make a simple table interactive for parties and board games


We use a RGB camera to detect objecs on the table and track them using modified algorithms from OpenCV.
The goal is to track glasses, cards,... to project animations around them using a projector.

The user can then interact with the interface projected using little stylus equipped with IR leds so that clics are detected by an IR camera.

This should allow the computer to manage board games, add cool effects on the table (if someone looses for instance) et can animate parties with cool custom effects around glasses.
